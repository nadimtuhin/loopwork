# FIX-007: Fix Resource Constraints in CLI Executor Tests

## Goal
Resolve memory/handle exhaustion in 'cli-executor.test.ts'. Cleanup 'child_process.spawn' mocks, remove lingering event listeners, and clear timeouts. If instability persists, force serial execution with '// @bun-test-sequence'.
## Files
- `packages/loopwork/test/cli-executor.test.ts`
**Estimated Time:** 60 min
**Complexity:** ★★★★☆ (4/5)

## Requirements
- Implement the functionality described above
- Follow existing code patterns and conventions
- Add appropriate error handling
## Edge Cases to Handle
- Platform-specific process behavior
- Timing dependent tests

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Feature implemented as described
- [ ] Code follows project conventions
- [ ] No new errors or warnings introduced
## Test Strategy
Run bun test packages/loopwork/test/cli-executor.test.ts. Verify process exit and no memory warnings.
