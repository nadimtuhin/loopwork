**Estimated Time:** 30 min

## Requirements
- Implement the functionality described above
- Follow existing code patterns and conventions
- Add appropriate error handling
## Edge Cases to Handle
- Global object pollution

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Feature implemented as described
- [ ] Code follows project conventions
- [ ] No new errors or warnings introduced
## Test Strategy
Run bun test packages/loopwork/test/00-utils.test.ts in isolation and in sequence with other tests.
