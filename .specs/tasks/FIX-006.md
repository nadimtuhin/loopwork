# FIX-006: Fix Monitor Unit Test Resource Cleanup

## Goal
Improve teardown logic in '00-monitor-unit.test.ts'. Ensure filesystem mocks and spawned processes are cleaned up reliably in 'afterEach' to prevent resource exhaustion during the test run.
## Files
- `packages/loopwork/test/00-monitor-unit.test.ts`
**Estimated Time:** 30 min
**Complexity:** ★★☆☆☆ (2/5)

## Requirements
- Implement the functionality described above
- Follow existing code patterns and conventions
- Add appropriate error handling
## Edge Cases to Handle
- Filesystem lock contention

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Feature implemented as described
- [ ] Code follows project conventions
- [ ] No new errors or warnings introduced
## Test Strategy
Run bun test packages/loopwork/test/00-monitor-unit.test.ts multiple times to ensure stability.
