# INKTERMI-004: Create Ink-based CompletionSummary component

## Goal
Rewrite CompletionSummary from output.ts as an Ink component that displays task statistics, duration, success/failure counts, and next steps. Support both detailed and compact modes. Include color-coded status indicators using Ink's Text color props. Ensure proper formatting of durations (human-readable time), emoji status icons with fallbacks, and multi-line next steps rendering. Add tests for various summary shapes (all passed, some failed, zero tasks, etc.).

## Requirements
- Implement the functionality described above

- Add appropriate error handling

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Feature implemented as described
- [ ] Code follows project conventions
- [ ] No new errors or warnings introduced
