# Root Bun configuration for loopwork monorepo
# See: https://bun.sh/docs/runtime/bunfig

[test]
# Global test timeout in milliseconds (10 seconds)
# This prevents runaway tests from becoming orphan processes
# Individual packages can override this in their own bunfig.toml
timeout = 10000

# Don't run tests in parallel at root level
# Each package manages its own parallelization
# parallel = false

[install]
# Use workspaces
# Bun auto-detects from package.json workspaces field
